## The roadmap.

### What the system should and shouldn't be able to do

- Development steps
  - Appointment managements
  - Patient managements
  - Staff managements
  - Inventory Managements
  - Financial management
  - Insurance Managements
  - Reports managements
  - Patient self-service

Due to insufficient manpower we are currently working with the first four sections.

## Are we in need of anything ?

Actually yes. We are real in need of Health professionals such as doctors, nurses or anyone with such kind of knowledge of how health organizations work to re-direct us of the working flow, data collections, required reports etc. Also since we are expecting to include an finacial records as show in the [Development steps](what-the-system-should-and-shouldn't-be-able-to-do) and there is a flow of currency within an organization we are also expecting to need anyone with accouting knowledge.
